# Hello programming World!

I decided it was about time for me to start learning git, docker, and cpp. Let's see where this brings me!

I'm working on a Macbook. First of all, I downloaded and installed docker

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

and git

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git

Open a terminal to verify the installation was successful:

```bash
$ git --version
```
